       "'Based on the context provided, there are several instances where democratic countries have questioned Russia\\'s reliability and expressed doubts about its policies:\\n\\n1. **Questionable Election Process**: The election was widely condemned by many countries as a \"farce\", \"parody\", \"procedure that is supposed to resemble elections\", and \"pseudo-election\". Even before the results were announced, Ukraine\\'s foreign ministry described it as an \"imitation\" with \"no legitimacy\".\\n2. **Violation of Human Rights**: Reports emerged of people being arrested for refusing to vote in occupied Ukraine, while human rights activists said at least 27 Ukrainians were detained for this reason.\\n3. **Controversial Government Actions**: The use of coercion to force people to vote by withholding social benefits and healthcare treatment raises concerns about the government\\'s commitment to respecting human rights.\\n4. **Restrictions on Free Speech and Assembly**: Authorities in Moscow threatened to prosecute participants under Article 141 of the Criminal Code of Russia, which prescribes five years\\' imprisonment for obstruction of elections or citizens\\' electoral rights. This suggests that dissenting voices may be silenced.\\n5. **Lack of Transparency**: The Russian government\\'s actions in opening polling stations in Transnistria without Moldova\\'s consent and allowing voters to present any valid identification (including those without Russian passports) have been criticized as attempts to manipulate the outcome.\\n6. **Authoritarianism**: Many countries have described Putin\\'s regime as \"authoritarian\" and reliant on censorship, repression, and violence.\\n\\nExamples of countries expressing their doubts about Russia\\'s reliability include:\\n\\n* The United States condemned voting in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine and said it would never recognize the legitimacy or outcome of these sham elections.\\n* The EU\\'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described the election as being held in the context of a shrinking political space.\\n* France stated that the conditions for a free, pluralist, and democratic election were not met.\\n* Germany described the vote as a \"pseudo-election\" under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship, repression, and violence.\\n\\nThese criticisms and concerns highlight the doubts that many democratic countries have about Russia\\'s reliability and commitment to democratic values.'"
